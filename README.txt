TODO: 

1.
add unsorted & unfiltered checkboxes under plot (NOT related to fit; those can be filtered too except for fit param graph).
for 2D, comes back to how to display multiple types: I think standard is to only show those conforming to selected dataseries
xval-by-xval? in which case sorting order and filters of selected dataseries are used.

2.
add proper axes labels to databrowser

3.
fix data label parsing for 1D scan files

4.
get rid of dataclassfitting, dataclassgraphing, curvefitting
replace with
dataseriesprocessing, scandataprocessing, ____graphing
